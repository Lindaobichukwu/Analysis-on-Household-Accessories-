2. **More advertisment**, **Target marketing** and **Campaigns** need to be launched on **Groceries** and **Hosiery**. 

3. A **Questionnaire** needs to be sent out as to why **Womens**, **Mens** and **Shoes** product are the most bought items even when most buyers never bought the products. 
   **More marketing stretegy** need to be implemented on these top three products and Top buyers who do not buy these products need to convinced as to **How** and **Why** these    products have been loved by other top buyers.
